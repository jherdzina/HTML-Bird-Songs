        <h1>Rooster</h1>
        <p>Bird. An adult male chicken is called a “rooster” and an adult female is called a “hen.” Roosters are larger, usually more brightly colored, and have larger combs on top of their heads compared to hens. Chickens can fly but because they are heavy, they can only go about 60 meters (200 ft). They have bad senses of smell and taste, but good hearing. They scratch and claw at the ground, looking for food. Baby chicks can eat and walk without help soon after hatching but they still need help keeping warm. Hens lay up to 240 eggs in a year. Roosters have been on farms, crowing loudly, for about 5000 years!</p>
        <p>The screeching alarm call is unmistakably different from crowing. All the hens stay on lock down until the rooster deems it’s safe (and that would be by crowing the all clear). Birds that ignore the rooster’s alarm are the targets of predators and rarely get a second chance if they are up against a local (chicken hungry) hawk or eagle. In the death-match game of chicken vs hawk, the rooster is a hen’s best advantage and tips the scale in favor of the flock. The most vigilant roosters continue to screech even when the hawk tries subterfuge and hides immobile in a tree hoping that the rooster will forget about it.</p>
